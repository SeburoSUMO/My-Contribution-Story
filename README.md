# My-Contribution-Story

A long time ago, I was not as connected to world as I am now, I lacked the understanding and awareness of the Web and the wider Internet.  Growing up I was lucky to have parents that could not afford to buy me a PC as we would know it today but they helped build my affinity for the digital world through games consoles, an Acorn Electron and the Amstrad CPC6128 and playing solitaire on my Father's work laptop (not sure of the OS, but it was monochrome (possibly Windows 2).

It was in 1996 that my digital world came alive.  With the music of Oasis in the air, I ventured into the college computer centre with my user-name and initial password in hand.  I sat down, logged in and started to learn how to use Windows 3.1 and the college network.  I was not as expert as some, but I soon found the value in having a second 1.44 MB disk on which to store my work.

When I entered the workforce it was at a time when “the Web” was everywhere.  Everyone wanted to be on it, to use it and to try to earn money from it.  I was struggling with Windows NT 4.0 at work, but even then I understood the nature of files and space and the need to connect things.  I watched “The Net” (a BBC tech magazine programme) and enjoyed reading “Wired” magazine.

The next big leap forward was in 2001 when I procured an ex-work Toshiba Satellite laptop.  Running Windows 98 I had my own connection to the “pay as you go” Internet.  I could see and explore the world myself and it was vast.  In my ignorance, I was a full supporter of the Microsoft ecosystem and found myself avoiding third party software on the grounds they would not work so well with Windows.

This changed with the release of Internet Explorer 8.  The interface had changed with Internet Explorer 7, but it felt slow and clunky.  I had heard rumours of something called Firefox (I think it was Firefox 3) that was rumoured to be very very fast, so I decided to give it a try.  I could always remove it later…

Wow.  Faster, easier to use and the people behind it seemed really cool.  I got the update to Firefox 3.5 and began to appreciate that this was software with personality.  I decided to replace Outlook Express with Thunderbird and was again impressed with the speed and well built feel of the software.  I also started following a few blogs and any news stories about this rebel group of hackers trying to beat Internet Explorer and save the Web.

(Worth mentioning that my parents were on holiday in October 2013, staying at the Sheraton in Toronto.  They were impressed by the really nice people with their laptops who went to an ice hockey game one evening.)

Fast forward to late summer 2014 and the decision to get a “smart phone”, wanting to get an Android device so that I could use the mobile version of Firefox.  Amazing – I had a mobile version of Firefox, to browse the web on my mobile phone!  Awesome, but I discovered an issue with an add-on that I had installed that allowed me to view different RSS feeds on additional home screen panels.  It worked for many sites, just not Planet Mozilla.

Baffled, I read how to set up IRC and asked in #mobile, where someone called Margaret offered to fix it.  After about half an hour, it was ready to try again, and it worked!  This was cool for many reasons:

    • We were in different countries
    • ...communicating in real time
    • ...fixing some “open source” software
    • ..and the fix was available for everyone to use, globally.

This made me realise that there was something in this “open source” stuff I had been reading about and it made me feel a bit bad.  I had received this service, and was using this software, for free.  I had not opened my wallet, written a cheque or sent anyone any money.

I continued to use IRC, trying to help some of the people that appeared and asked questions about Firefox.  I must had made so many mistakes, but I was approached by a couple of contributors who recommended I join a team called SUMO, which I did in March 2015.

What happened next…?  That story is still being written…!
